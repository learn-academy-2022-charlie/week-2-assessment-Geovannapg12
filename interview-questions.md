# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: a parameter is a place holder for information. An argument is part of a function

  Researched answer: An argument is the information of a function, the parameters are place holders for the arguments.


2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: I know what .map() can do and from what i've seen in the syllabus, challenges and notes is that it can take arrays

  Researched answer: .map and .filter both have  predefined built-in parameters are the value, index, and array. the function has to take at lest one or more if needed. I guess thats when you do a function within  a function those are two parameters. I'm going over all this lessons again. 



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: map will take each part of the array, a number, string or whatever kind of info the array has and it will do the same process for each of those. The other one .filter will return the array with only the parts we need

  Researched answer: What .map does is that it iterated the info of the array. I didn't do a good job at explaining it. I forgot about the fact that .map returns an array with the same length. .filter returns the values that are truth or the values that we need.




4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: a method is a way to help resolve the code like .map or .filter. A function  is a code that follows certain steps to resolve the code.

  Researched answer: A function is a set of instructions detailing how to do a code.
  A method is a pre-made function, it saves is the necessity to do a whole function.




5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: It helps us find a specific item in the array

  Researched answer: What it does is that it takes data from the array or other type of variable and makes it into a new one. Or at least that is what I undestand from the definition
  "JavaScript expression that allows us to extract data from arrays, objects, and maps and set them into new, distinct variables.""




6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: To be completely honest I'm pretty sure i've heard this before but right now the only thing I can think of is that it has something to do with React.

  Researched answer: So hoisting in JavaScript basically means that variables, const, let, go on top of the function. According to W3Schools the function will return an undefined
  "Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top"
  "Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function)."



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: Using class inheritance you can add more information. Changes parts of it to make it dynamic so you can use it multiple times but its not repeated.

2. React: It is used to control and change how the view of a page looks like

3. React state: "It's a built-in react object", its purpose is to handle data and information.

4. React lifecycle methods: This has like steps or a cycle that has three parts, Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting. Its used to monitor and manipulate.

5. DOM: stands for Document Object Model and what it does is that it accesses  and updates the content, I believe its so you don't have to refresh the page each time one change is made.
